# homework-2

In this assignment we created a basic layout of what is to become our homepage using Bootstrap.  The focus was mostly on creating a responsive page that can be viewed on devices with varying screen sizes.

I looked through Bootstrap's documentation and tried some things with varying levels of success.  One particular thing I found some success in is with using their class system for margins and spacings.

I tried adding a footer and it became much more complicated than I anticipated.  One would think you could just use some component in Bootstrap and voila!  A footer!  However, if you don't want a sticky footer (which I didn't), it involved having to do some weird workarounds, such as extending the body content, eliminating/adding margins, and spacings.  I had to look this part up on stackexchange.

The rest of it should be made clear through the comments included.

Future plans include possibly adding more images, such as in the navbar background instead of the default bootstrap color, adding icons (brand, facebook link, email, etc), making the entire card/image for portfolio items a button, and maybe toying with different fonts.
